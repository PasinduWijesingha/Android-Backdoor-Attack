# Android-Backdoor-Attack
<h1>Android attack using Metasploit framework in Parrot OS </h1> 
<p> “Android is a rapidly growing and popular 
smartphone and handheld computer operating system. Cyber
attacks on Android devices are increasing because of the abuse 
of android apps which lead to an invasion of the data protection 
of the victim. One means of avoiding hacking device and 
network penetration tests is feasible and necessary. This
research article utilizes the Parrot operating system to develop 
a platform that permits remote control of the device's Android 
operating system using malicious payloads through penetration 
tools such as the Metasploit framework, in order to perform a 
security test and identify device flaws. The main goal was to 
research Metasploit payloads, evaluate them, and control the 
target device. It may be used in legal situations, where it will be 
highly useful to police officers, law enforcement agencies, and 
investigators to have access to the devices and whereabouts of 
criminals and suspects without having direct touch with their 
equipment. This study will expose the process of creating a 
malicious payload, executing a security test, and collecting data 
from the target devices, as well as the many methods used by 
cybercriminals and black-hat hackers to get access to their 
target devices, such as injecting the payload into an original 
program, Location, SMS, PDF file, and Image (JPEG) file. 
Paper summarily describes penetration testing, Parrot tools 
like Metasploit Framework. These tools have proved to be 
effective in android exploitation. By using Metasploit, generate 
payload mistreatment msfvenom. It creates a backdoor to 
induce access to the system.”
